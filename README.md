📄 OCR Application for Digitizing Handwritten Documents
🔍 Overview
In today’s fast-evolving digital landscape, this project presents a web-based intelligent application that leverages Google's Gemini Generative AI through its API, combined with the power of Streamlit and Python for rapid development and real-time interaction.

The system enables users to interact with a large language model via a seamless, intuitive interface to perform tasks such as:

✍️ Handwritten Document Recognition

🧠 Content Generation & Summarization

🌐 Translation & Code Assistance

💬 Idea Brainstorming

📄 JSON Conversion of Extracted Text

This application processes scanned handwritten documents, extracts their textual content using AI-based OCR techniques, and structures the output into searchable formats.

🚀 Features
Real-time interaction with Google Gemini via API

AI-based OCR for handwritten text recognition

Convert scanned content into JSON for structured data handling

Customizable prompts for diverse use cases

Session-based memory and response generation

Responsive UI using Streamlit

Use cases in education, digital content creation, productivity, and historical document digitization
